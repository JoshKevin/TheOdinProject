    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What is this is Adobo. Adobo is marinating a food in soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. Pork
        can also be used, though we will be using chicken today. Chicken Adobo is one of first dishes I learned to cook
        since it's easy. Though it can also be hard to please a Filipino since every Filipino family has their own way
        of cooking it.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list-container">

        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Peppercorn</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="list-container">
        <li>Mix Soy Sauce, Vinegar and 3 cushed clove of Garlic in a deep bowl and marinate the chicken part in it for
            at least an hour. Marinating it for overnight would be better. </li>
        <li>Heat a pot, and put a little bit of oil on it.</li>
        <li>Mince garlic and onion.</li>
        <li>Grab your tongs and put the marinated chicken on the pot one by one. Cooking chicken adobo this way means
            the skin of the chicken will not disintegrate.</li>
        <li>Put the minced garlic and onion in the pan now. Wait for the onion to be translucent. </li>
        <li>Pour the marinade in and wait for it to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leaves and the peppercorn.</li>
        <li>Add additional soy sauce, vinegar or sugar for taste. Balance the taste, this will depend on your taste.</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>
