    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What we will be cooking today is Ginisang Ampalaya. Ampalaya is bittergourd in English, and ginisa can just be
        translated as sautee. So in this recipe, we will be sauteing the ampalaya with egg, onion, garlic and more. This
        is Kevin's favorite food since he was a child.</p>

        <li>Slice your Ampalaya into two lengthwise halves. Use a spoon to scoop the white part in the middle.</li>
